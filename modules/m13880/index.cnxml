<para id="id15707490">Although the discrete-time signal x(n) could be any ordered
sequence of numbers, they are usually samples of a continuous-time
signal.  In this case, the real or imaginary valued mathematical
function x(n) of the integer n is not used as an analogy of a
physical signal, but as some representation of it (such as samples).
In some cases, the term digital signal is used
interchangeably with discrete-time signal, or the label digital
signal may be use if the function is not real valued but takes
values consistent with some hardware system.

<para id="id14574237">Indeed, our very use of the term ``discrete-time" indicates the
probable origin of the signals when, in fact, the independent
variable could be length or any other variable or simply an ordering
index. The term ``digital" indicates the signal is probably going to
be created, processed, or stored using digital hardware.  As in the
continuous-time case, the Fourier transform will again be our
primary tool.

<para id="id15709836">Notation has been an important element in mathematics.  In some
cases, discrete-time signals are best denoted as a sequence of
values, in other cases, a vector is created with elements which are
the sequence values.  In still other cases, a polynomial is formed
with the sequence values as coefficients for a complex variable. The
vector formulation allows the use of linear algebra and the
polynomial formulation allows the use of complex variable theory.
